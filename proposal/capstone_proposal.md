## Proposal
### Domain Background

Running a profitable business is quite complicated. You have to keep juggling lots of balls at the sametime. Juggling those balls and keeping them in the air comes down to the ability to make lots of small decisions everyday. Taking out the guesswork out of the decision process can make all the difference between successful and failed businesses.


Entrepreneur at heart I am always interested in understanding how businesses work and that can't be separated from understanding human behviour.

### Problem Statement

Software as a service ( SaaS ), specially subscription based services, rely on the existing customer base to cover their expenses and to generally maintain a healthy cashflow. Customer churning can cost a business dearly in;
- cost of aquiring new customers
- Bad publicity through word of mouth

### Datasets and Inputs

Because of the great difference between services types, subscriptions, etc... the model is highly senstive to the dataset that it will train on.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

The main objective of the projet is to build a model to predict if a customer is going to churn or not. Given data about the user usage of the service the model can classify into two classes: churning or not-churning

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
