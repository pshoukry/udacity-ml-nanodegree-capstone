## Proposal
### Domain Background

Running a profitable business is quite complicated. You have to keep juggling lots of balls in the sametime. Juggling those balls and keeping them in the air comes down to the ability to make lots of small decisions everyday. Taking out the guesswork out of the decision process can make all the difference between a successful and failed businesses.

Software as a service ( SaaS ) specially subscription based services rely on the existing customer base on covering their expenses and on generally maintaining a healthy cache flow. Customer churning can cost a business dearly;
- cost of aquiring new customers
- Bad publicity through word of mouth

Enterpruener at heart I am always interested in understanding how businesses work and that can't be separated from understanding human behviour.

### Problem Statement

The main objective of the projet would be to be able to predict if a customer is going to churn or not in order to take corrective action. when given some collected data about the user usage the model should be able to predict if the user will churn or not.

### Datasets and Inputs

Because of the great difference between services types, subscriptions, etc... the model is highly senstive to the dataset that it will train on.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
